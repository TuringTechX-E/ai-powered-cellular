# **AI-Powered Cellular Insights Platform (AICP)**

### Accelerating Biomedical Discovery through AI-Driven Cellular Research

---

## **Overview**

The **AI-Powered Cellular Insights Platform (AICP)** is an open-source initiative to advance cellular biology through artificial intelligence. AICP enables researchers, biologists, and AI experts to collaboratively model, analyze, and simulate cellular behaviors in both healthy and diseased states. By integrating large-scale biological data with predictive models, AICP aims to accelerate the discovery and translation of basic research into groundbreaking treatments and therapies, supporting our mission to eradicate disease within this century.
